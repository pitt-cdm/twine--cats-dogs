<!-- Who is working on this project? -->








<!-- What's the basic pitch for the Twine narrative? Where do you start? Who do you play as? What's the genre? -->







<!-- What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through?

Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?

IMPORTANT: never include personal info like phone numbers on GitHub! -->









<!-- Feel free to add any further thoughts, plans, or possibilities... or to answer additional questions from the Group Contract on page 116 of Writer/Designer. -->
